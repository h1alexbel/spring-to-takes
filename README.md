There are slides for presenting the difference of [Spring](https://spring.io/), a popular Java framework,
and [Takes](https://www.takes.org), a rather small, but more object-oriented HTTP and RESTful framework.

To compile everything just run:

```bash
$ make
```

To clean everything up, do:

```
$ make clean
```

You need to have
[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX),
[`aspell`](http://aspell.net/),
[`texsc`](https://rubygems.org/gems/texsc),
and
[`texqc`](https://rubygems.org/gems/texqc)
installed.
